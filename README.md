# USER STORY GENERATOR

## Have you ever wondered just how much easier your life as a developer would be if you could automagically generate user stories?

---

Gone, I say, are the days of not being able to properly articulate what a normal user would want to do with a piece of software you are responsible for building!

Run this simple JavaScript file on your terminal and your problems are **over**, for indeed, the result of the program is a semantically orthodox (according to Atlassian) user story, generated from randomly-selected components and properly formatted as a complete English sentence.

That's half the battle right there, is it not?

You know it is.
